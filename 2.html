                I'm interested in Web, Android, IPhone, Illustration, Photoshop.
                I plan to design and create website.<br>
                It'll be my simple skill and hobby.
              </p>

                I want to make my own emoticon on Kakaotalk market.
                I have to install Illustration. T.T<br>
                I may share, show my emoticon and earn pocket money.
                Now, I'm a hungry, beautiful swan.

              <p>
                Before I tried to make a simple Android Application.<br>
                But It's not finished yet. The name is "One step, One step".

                    I like the Bewhy song. I listen to the song when I'm bored.
                    Recently, I play the song 'No Sky Is The Limit'.<br>
                    The lyrics are the best.
                </p>
               <p>
                    I like Ackdong Musican too. I like most of it. <br>
                    Yesterday(Today 6.18. at dawn), I heard the song, 'My Lost Sealed Castella'.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because I got delicious Castella Yesterday!<br>
                    I used to eat castella when I was elementary school.<br>
                    When my beloved aunt went to the bakery, she bought me a castella.<br>
                    I didn't like it when I was a kid, but I don't know why remember yesterday.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's so fun. I wish you hear it. I want to sing the song on Karaoke.
                </p>
                <p>    
                    And I want to introduce a song 'Monnani'.<br>
                    I like it. I wait someone sing the song.<br>
                    But, Sadly Both are unreleased songs. :(
