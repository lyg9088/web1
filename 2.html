                I'm interested in Web, Android, IPhone, Illustration, Photoshop.
                I plan to design and create website.<br>
                It'll be my simple skill and hobby.

                I want to make my own emoticon on Kakaotalk market.
                I have to install Illustration. T.T<br>
                I may share, show my emoticon and earn pocket money.
                Now, I'm a hungry, beautiful swan.

                    I like the Bewhy song. I listen to the song when I'm bored.
                    Recently, I play the song 'No Sky Is The Limit'.<br>
                    The lyrics are the best.

                    I like Ackdong Musican too. I like most of it. <br>
                    Yesterday(Today 6.18. at dawn), I heard the song, 'Stolen Lost Sealed Castella'.<br>
                    It's so fun. I wish you hear it. I want to sing the song on Karaoke.

                    And I want to introduce a song 'Monnani'.<br>
                    I like it. I dream someone sing the song to me.<br>
                    But, Sadly Both are unreleased songs. T.T
